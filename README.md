# Sparta-Model-Relationships

# Description

Go over everything that we have covered today and build out another Rails project with no Scaffolding, only the models.

We should have 3 resources of our choice, where we seed at least 1 of them to generate some information.

I used faker to generate the information for the resource

I will also be covering one to many relationships and I have done so through 1 person having many pets

I have also added validation to the ruby models.

# Challenges

The biggest challenge I had was making sure the validations worked, as well as making the belong_to and has_many.

I was able to overcome these challenges once I realise I was supposed to use the table name that has been generated in plural rather than singular.
